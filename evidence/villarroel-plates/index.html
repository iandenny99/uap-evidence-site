    <h1>Pre-Sputnik satellite-like tracks on historical plates (Villarroel et&nbsp;al.)</h1>

    <section class="card">
      <h3>TL;DR</h3>
      <p>Peer-reviewed analyses of mid-20th-century astronomical photographic plates report anomalous, satellite-like tracks appearing on plates taken <em>before</em> the first human satellite (Sputnik, 1957). Authors call for independent replication and strict checks for plate artefacts or processing errors.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h3>What happened (facts & dates)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Historical sky survey plates (e.g., Palomar) from the early–mid 1950s were re-examined.</li>
        <li>Authors report multiple linear, satellite-like trails on some plates that predate human satellite launches.</li>
        <li>The work is presented in peer-reviewed venues and invites replication by independent teams.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="card">
      <h3>Status</h3>
      <p><strong>Un-debunked / Open to replication.</strong> Findings are under active discussion; replication with modern scans, controls for artefacts, and independent pipelines is encouraged.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h3>Why it matters</h3>
      <p>If verified, these tracks would suggest artificial-looking objects in orbit prior to known human launches — a potentially transformative historical datapoint warranting mainstream investigation.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h3>Critiques & replication notes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Check for plate defects, scratches, processing artefacts, or contamination (controls with blank plates and different emulsions).</li>
        <li>Re-scan at high resolution; use independent image-processing pipelines.</li>
        <li>Cross-reference with observatory logs and plate metadata (date/time, exposure, instrument).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h3>Suggested questions for journalists</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Which plates and dates show the clearest trails? Are raw scans publicly accessible?</li>
        <li>What independent replications (if any) have been attempted, and with what controls?</li>
        <li>If artefacts are ruled out, what hypotheses remain consistent with the data?</li>
      </ul>
