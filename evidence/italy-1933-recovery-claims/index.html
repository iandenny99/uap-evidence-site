    <h1>Alleged 1933 Italy recovered craft (referenced in later testimony)</h1>

    <section class="card">
      <h3>TL;DR</h3>
      <p>Historical claims and archival references describe a purported recovered craft in Italy in the early 1930s. This page collates available documents, provenance notes, and how later witnesses have referenced this case. It is a framework for journalists to verify, compare sources, and pursue primary records.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h3>What happened (facts & timeline scaffolding)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Early 1930s:</strong> Italy-related claims about a recovered unconventional craft begin appearing in later accounts and archival references.</li>
        <li><strong>Post-WWII to recent years:</strong> The story resurfaces periodically in books, archives, and testimony references.</li>
        <li><strong>Recent references:</strong> Later witnesses have cited this case when discussing earlier recoveries (see <a href="../../people/witnesses/">Witnesses</a>).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Note:</em> This entry is a working dossier intended for corroboration and sourcing; dates and particulars should be pinned to documents wherever possible.</p>

      <h3>Status</h3>
      <p><strong>Under documentation / Open to verification.</strong> This page records leads and sources; items should be weighed by provenance, chain of custody, and ability to independently inspect originals.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h3>Why it matters</h3>
      <p>If substantiated with primary records, an early-1930s recovery claim would materially shift historical baselines and connect to later allegations of long-running analysis or reverse-engineering programmes.</p>

      <h3>Critiques & due-diligence checklist</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Authenticate documents (paper, stamps, signatures, contemporaneous references; archive catalogue numbers).</li>
        <li>Seek independent copies or parallel records (minutes, cables, inventory logs).</li>
        <li>Map provenance (who held originals, when, and how they were transferred).</li>
        <li>Cross-check later testimony against verifiable archival facts.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="card">
      <h3>Suggested questions for journalists</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Which repositories hold the best candidate primary documents, and are high-resolution images available?</li>
        <li>Do any contemporaneous newspapers, diplomatic cables, or military logs reference an unusual recovery?</li>
        <li>Which named officials or offices appear in documents, and are there corroborating records elsewhere?</li>
      </ul>
