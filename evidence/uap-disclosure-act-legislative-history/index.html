    <h1>UAP Disclosure Act (2023–2025): text, what survived, and documented pushback</h1>

    <section class="card">
      <h3>Headline</h3>
      <p><em>“If this Act was created, there’s not just smoke—there’s a forest fire already ablaze.”</em></p>
      <p>This page assembles the <strong>official texts</strong> of the UAP Disclosure Act proposals and the <strong>final law</strong> that passed in December 2023, then traces the <strong>negotiations and public statements</strong> around why the strongest provisions were removed. It also documents <strong>campaign-finance context</strong> for key lawmakers frequently named in reporting and commentary.</p>
      <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The original 2023 and 2024 proposals were modeled on the JFK Records Act and included an independent <em>UAP Records Review Board</em> and a clause directing the federal government to <em>“exercise eminent domain”</em> over privately held <em>“recovered technologies of unknown origin”</em> and <em>“biological evidence of non-human intelligence.”</em> Those features <strong>did not survive</strong> into the final FY2024 NDAA; what passed was a weaker framework requiring NARA to build a UAP records collection.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h3>1) What the original proposals said (primary sources)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>UAP Disclosure Act of 2023</strong> — text of Senate Amendment SA&nbsp;797 to the FY2024 NDAA (official): <a href="https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/senate-amendment/797/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Congress.gov: SA 797 full text</a>. See Section “Disclosure of recovered technologies …” which states the government shall “<em>exercise eminent domain over any and all recovered technologies of unknown origin and biological evidence of non-human intelligence</em>”.</li>
        <li><strong>Senate majority PDF of the amendment</strong> (official release): <a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/uap_amendment.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats.senate.gov: UAP amendment PDF</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>UAP Disclosure Act of 2024</strong> — text of Senate Amendment SA&nbsp;2610 (re-proposed for the next NDAA cycle), which again includes the eminent-domain clause and independent Review Board: <a href="https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/senate-amendment/2610/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Congress.gov: SA 2610 full text</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Why this mattered:</strong> The independent board + eminent-domain clause aimed to pull any privately held legacy materials into a lawful, reviewable process and prevent further fragmentation or concealment across contractors and agencies.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h3>2) What actually became law in December 2023</h3>
      <p>Congress passed the FY2024 NDAA with a <em>pared-back</em> UAP section:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Public Law 118-31</strong> (FY2024 NDAA) — enacted Dec&nbsp;22, 2023 (official): <a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/plaws/publ31/PLAW-118publ31.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PDF of the law</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>NARA guidance</strong> implementing Sections 1841–1843 (creates a UAP Records Collection and sets agency deadlines): <a href="https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/uap-guidance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">archives.gov/uap-guidance</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Notably <em>missing</em> from the final law:</strong> the independent Review Board and the eminent-domain provision; press and floor statements at the time described this as the bill being “gutted” during conference.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h3>3) Negotiations & public statements about the “gutting”</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sen. Schumer’s public statements</strong> that the House negotiators stripped the independent board (video): <a href="https://www.c-span.org/clip/us-senate/user-clip-chuck-schumer-on-uap-part-ndaa/5095976" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C-SPAN clip</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/senschumer/videos/it-is-an-outrage-the-house-didnt-work-with-us-on-our-uap-proposal-for-a-review-b/681318160657270/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statement video</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Contemporary coverage</strong> noting a stripped-down outcome with only an archive mandate, not an independent board: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/15/ufo-records-release-congress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Guardian (Dec&nbsp;15, 2023)</a> and <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a46105999/uap-disclosure-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Popular Mechanics explainer</a>.</li>

      <h3>4) Frequently named lawmakers & funding context</h3>
      <p>In press coverage and commentary, <strong>Rep. Michael R. Turner</strong> (House Intelligence Chair) and <strong>Sen. Roger Wicker</strong> (then Senate Armed Services Ranking Member) are frequently cited as opposing stronger provisions. <em>Allegations about their exact roles are contested</em>; for a neutral baseline, here are nonpartisan finance profiles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rep. Michael R. Turner (OH-10)</strong> — 2023–2024 cycle top industries include “Misc Defense” and “Defense Aerospace”: <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/michael-r-turner/summary?cid=N00025175" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenSecrets summary</a> (see “Top Industries”).</li>
        <li><strong>Sen. Roger Wicker (MS)</strong> — 2019–2024 combined cycles: defense-linked contributors appear in his “Top Contributors/Industries”: <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/roger-wicker/summary?cid=N00003280" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenSecrets summary</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5) Timeline (concise)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Jul&nbsp;2023:</strong> Schumer–Rounds file the <em>UAP Disclosure Act of 2023</em> (SA&nbsp;797) with the independent board + eminent domain clause.

        <li><strong>Jul&nbsp;2024:</strong> A substantially similar <em>UAP Disclosure Act of 2024</em> (SA&nbsp;2610) is filed; the eminent-domain clause reappears in the text. (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/senate-amendment/2610/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">text</a>)</li>
        <li><strong>2025:</strong> Additional UAP transparency efforts (outside the Schumer–Rounds package) are introduced (e.g., House measures and hearings), with outcomes still developing at time of writing.</li>
