      <h2>United Kingdom — Institutional Gatekeeping</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike the U.S., the UK has <em>no prominently named individual “gatekeepers.”</em> Instead, long-standing <strong>institutional policy</strong>
        functions as the gate: the Ministry of Defence ceased investigating UFO/UAP reports in <strong>2009</strong> and has repeatedly stated
        there are <strong>no plans</strong> to re-establish a dedicated team. That stance keeps the issue below the political/media radar.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-questions/detail/2024-12-05/18321/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parliamentary answer (Dec 2024): MoD ceased UAP work in 2009; no new team planned</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2021-06-30/debates/C3B3E127-A168-4315-A1C9-B4D7CC80895D/UnidentifiedFlyingObjects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House of Lords debate (June 2021)</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.janes.com/osint-insights/defence-news/air/uaps-pose-no-military-threat-uk-government-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Janes: UK govt says UAPs pose no military threat (Dec 2024)</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Implication for journalists:</strong> In the UK, focus FOI requests and scrutiny on <em>policy, procurement, and inter-agency coordination</em>
        rather than named blockers. Ask: who receives UK military UAP incident reports today? What is the escalation path? Which offices interface with allies on UAP data?
