      <h1>You don’t need to be Sherlock Holmes to spot a pattern here.</h1>

      <p><strong>Let’s start with a quick update:</strong> the old name “UFO” (<em>Unidentified Flying Object</em>) has been replaced by “UAP” — <em>Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon</em>.</p>

      <p>If you’re not yet up to speed: UAPs are no longer a fringe “conspiracy theory”. That dust has settled. Yet the jaw-dropping revelations that have become public have somehow skirted mainstream news coverage. Why? That’s a separate discussion — but it’s a big one.</p>

      <p><strong>So, for just a moment, set aside automatic scepticism.</strong> If even one of the following is true, the implications for energy, science and public trust are enormous:</p>

      <div class="grid" style="margin-top:12px;">
        <div class="card"><strong>We are not alone.</strong></div>
        <div class="card"><strong>Governments have kept aspects of UAP and recovered materials secret for decades.</strong></div>
        <div class="card"><strong>Some programmes appear aimed at analysing or reverse-engineering recovered craft.</strong></div>
        <div class="card"><strong>There are signals of transformative energy technologies (often described as “zero-point”).</strong></div>
      </div>

      <p style="margin-top:12px;">
        This site assembles primary sources and serious leads. If the BBC applies Watergate-level rigour here, the public will be better informed — whichever way the facts fall.
      </p>

      <p>
        Don’t you think — as a UK licence payer or a concerned citizen anywhere — that the BBC should investigate this on our behalf? It’s a publicly funded organisation, accountable to the people of the UK.
      </p>

      <p>
        And if even a fraction of what’s alleged is true, the upside is historic: clean, abundant energy that could accelerate decarbonisation, restore trust in institutions through sunlight and accountability, and unlock scientific breakthroughs we can scarcely imagine.

      <h3>Recommended UK Contact for the BBC</h3>
      <p><strong>Christopher Sharp</strong> has been the most active UK journalist investigating the UAP issue from a British perspective. He founded <a href="https://www.liberationtimes.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liberation Times</a>, a specialist outlet dedicated to this unfolding story.</p>
      <p>Any BBC reporter beginning an investigation should first liaise with Christopher Sharp. His reporting traces UK government involvement, identifies potential gatekeepers, and connects with international whistleblowers.</p>

      <h2 style="margin:0 0 8px;">What would disclosure mean to you?</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine uncovering technologies that could deliver affordable, planet-saving energy — cutting bills, slashing emissions, and accelerating climate repair. Disclosure could also unite people across borders: if we are not alone, we’re all on the same team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Breakthrough propulsion might shrink global travel from hours to minutes. Open scientific collaboration could trigger advances in materials, medicine and computing. Just as importantly, a real investigation would rebuild public trust by replacing rumours with records, and stigma with facts.
